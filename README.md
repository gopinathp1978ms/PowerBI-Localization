# PowerBI Localization

We use external tool called "Tabular editor" [Tabular Editor](https://tabulareditor.com/) to localize Power BI Chart titles, legends,  chart series, etc.

1. Clone the git repo to your development environment - you can use git on the command line, or Visual Studio's built-in Azure DevOps UX.
1. Create and check out a new branch off of `master` for your work. Please use the branch naming convention `users/[alias]/[topic]` for work you are doing by yourself. Larger features may use the `features/[topic]` pattern. A quick way to do this on the command line is with the `git checkout -b [branch_name]` command; you can also use the Team Explorer in Visual Studio.
1. Make changes to the code, commit them to your local branch, and push that local branch to the Azure DevOps-hosted `remote origin`.
1. Create a Pull Request (PR) in Azure Devops from your branch into `master`.
1. Address any PR comments by pushing additional commits, and then complete the pull request.
